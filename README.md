Hi I'm David, a Software Engineer from London.

I am a very user-focused engineer, I believe in creating experiences that
everyone can interact with and enjoy. Coming from a musical background I see
myself as quite creative, I have more of an affinity for Frontend development
because of my love of sleek & innovative design but I also love creating and
architecting scalable Backend services and APIs.
